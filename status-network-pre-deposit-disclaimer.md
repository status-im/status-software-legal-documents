# Status Network Pre-Deposit Disclaimer

## 1. About This Disclaimer

In this Disclaimer, references to “we”, “our”, “us” or “Status” refer to Status Research & Development GmbH, a Swiss company with its registered office at Baarerstrasse 10, Zug, Switzerland.

## 2. Pre-Deposit Phase

Status Network is a zkEVM Layer 2 solution built by Status on the Linea stack. Its long-term vision is to become a sustainable, permissionless, and decentralised rollup.

As part of the anticipated mainnet launch of Status Network, currently targeted for Q1 2026 but not guaranteed, participants may voluntarily deposit assets into non-custodial smart contract vaults, referred to as the Vaults, during the pre-deposit phase, referred to as the Pre-Deposit Phase.

Assets that may be deposited during the Pre-Deposit Phase include:
- SNT on Ethereum L1
- LINEA on Linea L2
- ETH
- Certain US stablecoins on Ethereum L1

Participants depositing assets during the Pre-Deposit Phase lock their assets in the Vaults pending bridging to Status Network upon mainnet activation.

Additional details regarding the Pre-Deposit Phase, potential rewards, and Vault operations are available at:  
https://status.app/blog/status-network-pre-deposit-vaults-be-early-to-the-gasless-l2

Any potential rewards are not guaranteed and may be modified or discontinued at any time without notice.

## 3. Non-Custodial Nature of the Vaults

The Vaults are immutable smart contracts created via Aragon.

Neither Status nor any of its affiliates, employees, contractors, or service providers, collectively referred to as the Status Parties, have custody of, possession of, control over, or access to any assets deposited by participants into the Vaults at any time.

Status Parties are not agents or intermediaries of participants and do not store, access, or control participants' private keys, passwords, or wallets. Participants interact directly with the Vaults through non-custodial wallets. Once assets are deposited, they are governed exclusively by the underlying smart contract code.

## 4. Risks

Participation in the Pre-Deposit Phase involves inherent risks. Smart contracts and blockchain technologies are experimental and novel technologies and may be subject to vulnerabilities, technical failures, security incidents, or third-party failures.

Participants acknowledge that they may lose some or all of their deposited assets. Participants are solely responsible for understanding and assessing all risks prior to participation, including technical, operational, legal, and regulatory risks.

## 5. Miscellaneous

Status reserves the right to amend or update this Disclaimer at any time by publishing a revised version on its website. Any such updates become effective upon publication.
