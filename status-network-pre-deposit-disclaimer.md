# Status Network - Pre-Deposit disclaimer

## 1. About this Disclaimer

In this Disclaimer, whenever we are referring to “we”, to “we”, “our”, “us” (or variations thereof) or Status, we are referring to Status Research & Development GmbH, a Swiss Company, with its registered office at Baarerstrasse 10, Zug, Switzerland. 

## 2. Pre-Deposit Phase

Status Network is a zkEVM Layer 2 solution built by Status on the Linea stack. The long-term vision is for it to become a sustainable, permissionless, and decentralised rollup. 

As part of the anticipated mainnet launch of Status Network (targeted for Q1 2026, though not guaranteed), users can voluntarily deposit assets, including SNT (Ethereum L1), Linea (Linea L2), ETH and certain US stablecoins (Ethereum L1) into non-custodial smart contract vaults (“**Vaults**”) as part of the pre-deposit phase (“**Pre-Deposit Phase**”). Users depositing assets during the Pre-Deposit Phase lock their assets in the Vaults pending bridging to Status Network upon mainnet activation. 

Additional details of the Pre-Deposit Phase, potential rewards and Vault operations are set out here: https://status.app/blog/status-network-pre-deposit-vaults-be-early-to-the-gasless-l2. Any potential rewards are not guaranteed and may change without notice. 

## 3. Non-custodial nature of the Vaults

The Vaults are immutable smart contracts created by Aragon. Status, its affiliates, employees, contractors and service providers ("Status Parties") do not have custody of, possession, control or access to the deposited assets at any time. Status Parties are not agents or intermediaries of the user and do not store nor have access to or control over any user private keys or passwords. Users interact directly with smart contracts via non-custodial wallets. Once the assets are deposited by users, those are then governed exclusively by smart contract code. 

## 4. Risks

When you participate in the Pre-Deposit Phase, please be aware that there are risks involved because smart contracts are still experimental and novel technology. It could be that you might lose some or all of your assets, for example, because of technical problems, security issues (such as hacking) or third party failures. You are responsible for understanding these risks and any other risks, including technical, legal and regulatory, before you participate. 

## 5. Miscellaneous

Status reserves the right to amend this disclaimer at any time by posting the updated version on our website, upon which it takes effect.
