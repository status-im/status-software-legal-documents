Using the Status Browser Wallet, you are able to send, receive and store Digital Assets and connect to and interact with third-party services that enable the exchange of Digital Assets for fiat currency and Web 3, including certain blockchain bridges and decentralised exchanges.

Status Browser Wallet contains the latest security standards, anti-phishing mechanisms and locally generated and stored public and private keys to ensure that your Digital Assets are secured to the highest standards.

If you fail to maintain the appropriate security measures of your private keys, it may result in you losing access to the Status Browser Wallet and control of any Digital Assets in your Status Browser Wallet.

When using Status Browser Wallet, you may access or use third party products, services or tools (“Third Party Services”) and interact with Web 3. Status Browser Wallet is only one means of interacting with these Third Party Services and Web 3 and you can independently utilise other means and tools to do so as well.

Your interactions with Web 3 could include many aspects, such as interacting with smart contracts that reside on blockchain networks, for example to swap Digital Assets or use (crypto) bridges, s. You may also interact with and participate in peer-to-peer networks which could vary in their level of decentralisation, ranging from more centralised networks controlled by a single party to networks governed by decentralised communities.

When you use Third Party Services or interact with Web 3, you acknowledge that Status does not control or operate any Third Party Service or Web 3. These products, services, or tools are either controlled, operated, owned, or licensed by the third party providing them, or they may operate autonomously, independently of Status or any other party.

In case of interactions with Web 3, such as decentralised exchanges, there might be in some cases no applicable terms and conditions, and the relevant software code will govern your interactions.

Please also note that bridges are used to move tokens from one blockchain network to another. When you use a bridge, for example in the course of sending or bridging tokens, Status utilises an algorithm that aims to determine the lowest service fee which the user may incur at the time of a bridge’s use. This algorithm relies on information extracted directly from the relevant blockchain networks. Status is not responsible for the accuracy and correctness of any information that these algorithms may extract from such networks

You are solely responsible for your use of Third Party Services and your interactions with Web 3. If you have any technical issues or other issues with any of these Third Party Services or Web 3, you should contact the relevant third party or appropriate point of contact directly (if any).

Before you use Status Browser Wallet, you should understand the risks involved and how they may affect you. The risks listed below are not intended to be exhaustive and may not reflect all the potential risks you could be exposed to from using Status Browser Wallet.

By using Status Browser Wallet, you represent that you have a sufficient understanding about crypto wallets and Digital Assets.

You acknowledge that Digital Assets stored in the Status Browser Wallet are at risk of loss due to various factors, including but not limited to: theft, hacking (or other cyber-attacks), malware, technical or human error.

Transactions are processed by validators, nodes, miners, and other participants on the Web 3 network (and not by Status). We do not have visibility of and cannot interfere with, modify, stop, block, change, reverse, or refund any transactions.

2. ### **Novel and experimental nature of Web 3**

You acknowledge that there are inherent risks related to Web 3, arising from its novel and experimental nature. These risks include but are not limited to security risks (such as hacking and malware or other cyber-attacks, unauthorised access to Status Browser Wallet, attacks on blockchain networks, among others), technical risks (such as software errors, vulnerabilities or bugs) or operational risks related to Digital Assets, smart contracts, use of certain services, such as (crypto) bridges and swaps or other aspects and functionalities of Web 3.

The technology underlying Web 3 is also novel and experimental, as for the most part, it is based on still unproven, emerging and complex technologies, such as blockchain networks, that are developed or operated by third parties and distributed across a series of unaffiliated nodes across the world. As such, these changes and development in this technology may adversely affect your use of Web 3 and even Status Browser Wallet. It is your sole responsibility to monitor such changes and the potential impact on your use of Web 3 and Status Browser Wallet.

Given the novel and experimental nature of Web 3, the laws, rules and regulations, or their interpretation, may change and develop in a manner which could adversely affect your ability to interact with any aspect of Web 3, including deploying smart contracts, as well as creating, using, distributing or purchasing Digital Assets. These rules and regulations vary significantly in maturity across jurisdictions, but are for the most part, still in the early stages of development and may rapidly evolve and as such, their potential impact is subject to significant uncertainty. This could result in adverse consequences to you that may include criminal or civil penalties, including fines. It is your sole responsibility to ensure that you comply with all applicable laws, rules and regulations, including but not limited to, cryptocurrencies, financial markets, securities and anti-money laundering.

Web 3 is also decentralised to varying degrees and this may lead to a lack of predictability, accountability, or control over Web 3. There is no guarantee that the protocols and networks will function as expected. Changes may occur suddenly, like forks, which may affect Status Browser Wallet and your experience of using Status Browser Wallet. Status may decide not to support a forked network in its sole discretion.

3. ### **Unpredictable and volatile nature of Digital Assets**

With Status Browser Wallet, you can interact with and transact in Digital Assets and their markets. You acknowledge that these markets and Digital Assets are often highly unpredictable and volatile due to multiple factors, such as supply and demand, changes in technology, the regulatory environment, political, natural and economic events in a jurisdiction, and price speculation. In addition, the underlying factors that determine the price of a Digital Asset are often opaque and could be subject to speculation and market manipulation. This means that the value of Digital Assets can be lost in part or in full and you should not interact with Digital Assets unless you have the necessary advice, knowledge, expertise or risk appetite.

4. ### **Potential legal, regulatory and tax implications**

You acknowledge that there may be legal and regulatory implications applicable to you while using Status Browser Wallet and interacting with Web 3 and that may also adversely impact your use of Status Browser Wallet.
