Under the relevant data protection laws, we are under certain obligations if we process any personal data when you use Status Browser Wallet. Personal data means all information by which a person can be directly or indirectly identified, in line with the definitions of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), the Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection of June 19, 1992 (DPA) (as amended from time to time) and its ordinances, and other applicable law on the protection of personal data. When we refer to the relevant data protection laws in this Privacy Policy we mean GDPR, the DPA and any other applicable laws in this context.

This Privacy Policy describes, among other things, how we process the (limited) amount of personal data that we collect when you use Status Browser Wallet. We also inform you about your rights and choices that you have in respect of any personal data we process.

If you do not agree with this Privacy Policy or any part of it, please do not use Status Browser Wallet. If you are already using Status Browser Wallet, we ask that you immediately stop using Status Browser Wallet.

1. ### **Who we are**

Status is developing a set of open source projects that use peer-to-peer technologies to help people transact securely, communicate freely, and organise with confidence. Anyone participating in these projects helps to build technology and tools that empowers people to advance their own sovereign communities.

Whenever "Status" or "we" is used in this Privacy Policy, we're referring to Status Research & Development GmbH, a Swiss company with its registered offices at Baarerstrasse 10, 6302 Zug Switzerland. Our contact information can be found on our website and at the end of this Privacy Policy.

Status does not provide any services, such as financial services, to users of Status Browser Wallet or any third party. Status is not an intermediary, agent, advisor, or custodian, and does not owe you any fiduciary duty.

2. ### **Status Browser Wallet**

At Status, we strive to develop open source software that helps to uphold human rights. You can find out more details about its development on Status’ GithHub page.

The term “Status Browser Wallet” means this software developed by Status, being an open source client software crypto wallet that is designed to be user-friendly and can be installed or run in a web browser on your local desktop device. You can use Status Browser Wallet to interact with and participate in Web 3 protocols, applications and peer to peer networks. Please note that Status Browser Wallet is not a blockchain protocol, or a blockchain network, a platform or a web-based platform.

3. ### **Status processes personal data on a limited basis from your use of Status Browser Wallet**

Status processes personal data on a limited basis from users of Status Browser Wallet and the specific types of personal data we process will depend on how you use Status Browser Wallet. As such, we only collect and process personal data in the following instances:

1. **API Proxy Server**: When you use certain features of Status Browser Wallet, Status Browser Wallet will automatically interact with a server (“**API** **Proxy Server**”) that we control and has been implemented to improve the performance and security of Status Browser Wallet and acts as a critical intermediary between a user’s instance of Status Browser Wallet and a select number of third party service providers.

As part of the implementation of the API Proxy Server, certain information, including personal data, from the user’s instance of Status Browser Wallet, will be processed by Status through the API Proxy Server, which include the following:

- _the user’s IP address_: your IP address will be processed by Status when third party requests are run through the API Proxy Server. This however removes your individual device details and IP address when the API Proxy Server makes the external requests to the third party service provider. As a result, these third-party service providers will only see the IP address of the API proxy server, not your IP address. The API Proxy Server receives your IP address whenever your instance of Status Browser Wallet makes a https API call in the context of interacting with the following third party service providers:

  - CoinGecko;

  - Alchemy

- _the user’s public address (also known as a wallet address)_: when you conduct certain activities on Status Browser Wallet (e.g. transactions conducted by the user), your public address is processed by Status in the API Proxy Server when making API calls to third party service providers, such as Alchemy. Your public address is shared by the API Proxy Server with Alchemy;

- _Tokens a user might be interested in:_ when you query the price data of tokens with CoinGecko in Status Browser Wallet, your instance of Status Browser Wallet makes a https API call to the API Proxy Server as part of retrieving this information. Status will, through the API Proxy Server, process data that includes your query and the price data of the tokens that you queried for;

- _Details of transactions entered into by the user_: when you enter into a transaction through Status Browser Wallet, Status will process certain transaction information through the API Proxy Server. This includes the amounts and the sender and recipient(s) of the transaction, which contracts the user has interacted with and what functions are called in respect of those contracts. The details of the transaction are then shared by the API Proxy Server with Alchemy in order for the transaction to take place;

- _Your data queries and response to this data query_: when you make a data query, such as an ERC-20 token balance call of a particular public address, this information is also processed by Status through the API Proxy Server. The details of these queries are shared by the API Proxy Server with Alchemy in order for the data query to be completed.

We process the above personal data for the purposes of facilitating the technical operation of Status Browser Wallet and optimising the functionality and user’s experience of Status Browser Wallet. We have a legitimate interest in processing this personal data for these purposes.  \*\*\*\*

4. ### **Personal data sharing with third party service providers**

We share personal data with third party service providers in the context of fulfilling the above purposes in which we collect and process personal data. We have contracted such third party service providers to provide their services and act as data processors on our behalf and they are only permitted to process personal data in accordance with our instructions.

Third party service providers we engage and services we utilise from them include:

- _Google Cloud_: Providing hosting services in relation to the API Proxy Server;and

- _CoinGecko_: Providing data and information services around cryptocurrency prices;

- _Alchemy_: Providing RPC services;

- Moonpay: Providing on-ramp/buy crypto services,

- Mercuryo: Providing on-ramp/buy crypto services.  \_\_

5. ### **Third party collection and processing of personal data**

In addition to our limited collection of personal data, third parties themselves might collect or process personal data as a result of Status Browser Wallet making use of certain features, to provide certain content or making available to the user certain services as provided by third parties. For the avoidance of doubt, Status does not collect or process this personal data. To the extent you interact with such third party content or features, their respective privacy policies will apply.

We also note the following:

- _Web 3_: An inherent feature of Web 3 is its transparency, particularly in the context of blockchain networks. This means that your public key and wallet address will be visible to others when you engage in transactions on such networks and that third parties may be able to (and for the avoidance of doubt, not through the use of Status Browser Wallet) connect your public key and wallet address to your identity and determine the Digital Assets you own in your wallet. You should also be aware that entries on blockchain networks are practically immutable, which means that they generally cannot be deleted or modified by anyone, including Status, even if the transaction turns out to have been made in error or otherwise.

- _Other third party service providers_: Status Browser Wallet allows you to interact with a number of third party service providers, including on-ramp providers, cryptocurrency price service providers, NFT collectible service providers, swap providers and signature tooling providers. These providers might collect and process your personal data if you use their services. Please consult the relevant privacy policy of these third party service providers prior to your use of their services.

6. ### **Security measures we take in respect of Status Browser Wallet**

As a general approach, Status takes data security seriously and the measures we take as an organisation. In respect of Status Browser Wallet, we implement a variety of security measures that are reasonably designed to maintain the safety of your personal data when it is shared with us.

7. ### **Exporting personal data outside the European Union and Switzerland**

While it is not intended that Status will export your personal data outside the European Union or Switzerland, Status is obliged to protect the privacy of such personal data if it is exported outside these areas and it will only be processed in countries or by parties that provide an adequate level of protection as deemed by Switzerland or the European Commission. Otherwise, Status will use specific forms of contractual clauses to ensure such personal data is provided the same protection as required in Switzerland or Europe. The transmission of personal data outside the European Union and Switzerland will always occur in conformity with applicable data protection laws.

8. ### **Your choices and rights**

As explained in this Privacy Policy, Status limits its collection and processing of your personal data. Nonetheless, you still have certain choices and rights in respect of the personal data which we do collect and process. As laid out in relevant applicable data protection laws, you have the right to:

- Ask us to correct or update your personal data (where possible);

- Ask us to remove your personal data from our systems;

- Ask us for a copy of your personal data, which may also be transferred to another data controller at your request;

- Withdraw your consent to process your personal data (only if consent was asked for a processing activity), which only affects processing activities that are based on your consent and doesn't affect the validity of such processing activities before you have withdrawn your consent;

- Object to the processing of your personal data; and

- File a complaint with the Federal Data Protection and Information Commissioner (FDPIC), if you believe that your personal data has been processed unlawfully.

Once we receive your request, we might require you to verify your identity such that we can appropriately respond to your request and we will do so in line with any applicable mandatory deadlines. Please contact us with the relevant request at: <legal@status.im>.
